# Gokord

Gokord is a hard fork of [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) because:
- maintainers are inactives
- the code base does not follow Go recommendations (and it has many spelling mistakes in its docs)
- [maintainers do not want to upgrade Go and libraries used to a newer version fixing 4 CVE](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/pull/1528)

Check the [ROADMAP](/ROADMAP.md) for more information.

Gokord is a [Go](https://go.dev/) package that provides low level bindings to the [Discord](https://discord.com/)
chat client API.
Gokord has nearly complete support for all the Discord API endpoints, websocket interface, and voice interface.

## Getting Started

### Installing

This assumes you already have a working Go environment.

`go get` *will always pull the latest tagged release from the main branch.*

```sh
go get -u github.com/nyttikord/gokord
```

### Usage

Import the package into your project.

```go
import "github.com/nyttikord/gokord"
```

Construct a new Discord client which can be used to access the variety of  Discord API functions and to set callback
functions for Discord events.

```go
dg := gokord.New("Bot " + "authentication token")
// do some config things, like setting the intents or the sharding
err := dg.Open() // this starts the websocket and connect it to the Discord API.
```

See Documentation and Examples below for more detailed information.

## Documentation

**NOTICE**: This library and the Discord API are unfinished.
We are following the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and we plan to release the `1.0.0` after cleaning the
library.
Next major breaking changes will only be introduced when the major version is increased.
Please note that these breaking changes refer to our internal logic, not to the breaking changes introduced by Discord
in their API.

The Gokord code is fairly well documented at this point and this is currently the only documentation available.
Go reference (below) presents that information in a nice format.
