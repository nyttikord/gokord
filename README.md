# Gokord

Gokord is a hard fork of [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) because:
- maintainers are inactives
- the code base does not follow Go recommendations (and it has many spelling mistakes in its docs)
- [maintainers do not want to upgrade Go and libraries used to a newer version fixing 4 CVE](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/pull/1528)

Check the [ROADMAP](/ROADMAP.md) for more information.

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/nyttikord/gokord.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nyttikord/gokord) [![CI](https://github.com/nyttikord/gokord/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nyttikord/gokord/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Gokord is a [Go](https://golang.org/) package that provides low level 
bindings to the [Discord](https://discord.com/) chat client API. Gokord 
has nearly complete support for all the Discord API endpoints, websocket
interface, and voice interface.

[this page](https://golang.org/doc/install) first.

`go get` *will always pull the latest tagged release from the master branch.*

```sh
go get -u github.com/nyttikord/gokord
```

### Usage

Import the package into your project.

```go
import "github.com/nyttikord/gokord"
```

Construct a new Discord client which can be used to access the variety of 
Discord API functions and to set callback functions for Discord events.

discord, err := gokord.New("Bot " + "authentication token")
```

See Documentation and Examples below for more detailed information.


## Documentation

**NOTICE**: This library and the Discord API are unfinished.
Because of that there may be major changes to the library in the future.

The Gokord code is fairly well documented at this point and is currently
the only documentation available. Go reference (below) presents that information in a nice format.
